Adhi Kesavaperumal otherwise known as SriRamanujar temple is located at Sriperumbudur, kanchipuram district, Tamilnadu, South India. Sri Adikesava perumal and Yathirajavalli Thayar are the main deities here. Sri Ramanujar also has the equal importance. It is his birth place who bought out the value of the Manthra On Namo Narayana to the common people. Sri Ramanujacharya is the great philosopher, theologist and the important exponent of Visishtatvaidham. The temple is well maintained with sanctity. When you enter the temple itself one can feel the power of divinity. Chithirai Bramhotsavam ,  Masi pooram and Panguni Uthiram are the prominent festivals of the temple. Choffersithirai Thiruvadhirai is birth star of Sri Ramanujacharya, on this day Sri vaishnavites gather here in mass to anoint Sriramanujas idol with cow's milk (pal abhishekam). It is believed that if this offering is done people who do get married will get married soon. There is an Anjaneyar temple in the entrance of the street, which is also a powerful temple. On the whole it is one of the must visit Divyadesam of Srivaishnavites. Not only that the prasadam sold here especially puliyodharai and adhirasam holds exclusive taste and delicious. Of course a mouthwatering one. Frequent buses are there from Koyambedu and Saidapet. So don't delay to visit the temple and get the blessings of Dr I Ramanujacharya..
