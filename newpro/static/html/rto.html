"Shri Perumbudur Lake" is large lake stretching between "SH 57" and "Mumbai Highway" with mud bund expected to be pleasant or good for walking, nature watch &  bird watching.

However walking on most of mud bund is nightmare due to open defecation & growth of weeds. It is highly appreciated if concerned authorities take responsibility such that "Swachch Bharath" is  implemented across all lakes and open defecation to be stopped as soon as possible by building few community toilets around them.
